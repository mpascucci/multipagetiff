This module simplifies working with multipage images (stacks). Image stacks are often found as multi-page tiff files.

It implements depth color-coding by max-projection, like the Z-projection functions of ImageJ.

Detailed description on the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/mpascucci/multipagetiff/blob/master/README.md).
