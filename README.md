`multipagetiff` is a python module that simplifies working with multipage images (stacks). Image stacks are often found as multi-page tiff files.

With this module one can read/write, manipulate and display multi-page tiff files and apply depth color-coding by max-projection, like the Z-projection functions of ImageJ.
